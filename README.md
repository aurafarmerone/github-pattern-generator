# 🎨 GitHub Pattern Generator

> Draw your GitHub contribution story — one commit at a time.

**GitHub Pattern Generator** is an open-source web tool that allows you to visually design custom GitHub contribution graph patterns and export them as a `pattern.json` file. This JSON file can then be used with automated commit scripts to render beautiful patterns on your GitHub contribution graph.



## ✨ What is this?

GitHub contribution graphs are like a canvas made of pixels.
This project turns that canvas into a **pattern editor** where you can:

- 🖱️ Click to draw custom contribution patterns
- 🎯 Design shapes, text, or symbols
- 📦 Export the design as a `pattern.json` file
- 🤖 Use the JSON file with auto-commit tools to apply the pattern

All of this happens **directly in your browser** — no setup required.



## 🤔 Why use GitHub Pattern Generator?

- 🎨 **Visual & Intuitive** – draw patterns instead of guessing commit dates
- ⚡ **Fast & Lightweight** – built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- 🔁 **Reusable** – export patterns as JSON and reuse anytime
- 🧩 **Automation Friendly** – perfect for commit automation projects
- 🌍 **Open Source** – customize the UI, add features, or improve performance

Whether you want to create GitHub art, test automation scripts, or just experiment — this tool makes it simple.
